						<li><strong></strong></li><br>
<li><strong>Change your thinking and behavior.</strong> Your weight and health need to be front and center in your thinking. Remind yourself that maintaining your weight and living a healthy lifestyle are a permanent commitment, not a one-shot deal. Remember the many benefits that come with having a healthy weight - and the physical and health limitations that carrying too much weight can impose.</li>
<li><strong>Stay active.</strong> The human body is made to move, yet so many of our daily activities keep us from doing just that: driving, working at the computer, watching television. People of all ages and body types benefit from physical activity. Even if you have not been active in a long time, there are safe ways to get moving.</li>
<li><strong>Eat Wisely.</strong> A healthy diet goes hand-in-hand with an active lifestyle for avoiding weight gain. Eating lots of fruits, vegetables and whole grains; drinking plenty of water and avoiding too much alcohol, soda and other sugary drinks; and replacing fats with lean protein is the way to go.</li>
<li><strong>Get enough sleep.</strong> Research has shown that not getting a good night's rest can put you at greater risk for a host of health problems, including obesity. </li>
