			 			<li>Around the world, more than one billion adults are overweight and about 300 million of them are obese. In the United States, 66 percent of all adults are overweight and, of those, 32 percent are obese.</li>

<li>Obesity levels in Japan and some African nations are below 5 percent, but they’re rising. Obesity rates in China overall are not high, but in some of that country’s larger cities, rates are up 20 percent.</li>

<li>Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions, too. The number of overweight children in the United States has doubled since 1980, and for teens, it's tripled. And  problem with children is now a global issue as well.</li>
			 			<li>It used to be recommended that to lose a pound per week you would need to decrease total calories by 500 a day. Now researchers believe weight loss is a slower process and that a decrease of 10 calories a day leads to a loss of about one pound in a year, but it can take as long as 3 years to get there. The key is to be patient and work with a dietitian to help find the right plan for you.
For successful weight loss that you can maintain over time, experts recommend choosing foods that are lower in calories but rich in protein, vitamins, minerals, fiber, and other nutrients.</li>

					<p><li>There are a few formulas that measure your resting metabolic rate. A small July 2018 study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research shows that for athletes, the Harris-Benedict Equation was the most accurate for males. For females, the Cunningham Equation was the most accurate.</li>

<li>The Cunningham Equation, while fairly accurate, uses the amount of muscle mass in your body to calculate your resting metabolic rate, since muscle mass makes a large contribution to the total number of calories you burn while resting. The drawback is that it's extremely hard to figure out how much muscle mass you have in your body. For that reason, the Cunningham Equation probably isn't the best to use.</li>

<li>The Harris-Benedict Equation is a simpler calorie formula. It uses your age, height, body weight and gender to estimate the number of calories you burn at rest. However, it doesn't take into account how much muscle mass you have, which means it's not entirely accurate. It's still useful in giving you an estimate, and accurate enough to be the best formula to use.</li>

<li>The Mifflin St-Jeor Equation, like the Harris-Benedict Equation, actually has two different equations: one for males and one for females. Both require your age, height and weight as well. In some populations, the Mifflin St-Jeor equation is the best available, according to a July 2018 study published in Frontiers in Endocrinology.</li>

<li>In the study, the researchers looked at obese Caucasian subjects who had health risks like diabetes and high blood pressure. In this population, the Mifflin St-Jeor equation was superior to the Harris-Benedict equation.</li></p>
